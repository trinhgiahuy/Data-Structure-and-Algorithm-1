selection sort big-theta (n) only compare to insertion-sort which run time is n^2

MyAlgorithm(A)
 s := true, i := A.length - 1
 while s = true do
     s := false
     for j := 1 to i do
         if A[j + 1] < A[j] then
            exchange A[j] and A[j + 1]
            s := true
     i := i - 1
	 
	 
MyAlgorithm called double sort
Best case : Already sort, go through all value : n^2
Worst case : go trough all value many time n^2
