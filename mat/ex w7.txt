Ex :

find one common element from 2 list

Merge start from begin of both list
One by one and compare 


Other :

Combine sorted list


Combine 2 vectors 


MOst complicate:

When add element, add element to other list


n*const and n*logn
then merge 2 list => n logn



4/

binary_search : best case omega(1) worst case O(log n )


O(n^2):
log(n)*log(n)
while loop 

No element while loop does not execute. 
Omega(log(n))

Bugs: 
Line 5&6:

Erase iterator it invalid => cannot use iter. Iter may not point to
vector anymore.

6: Is not possible to increase since it is outside vct => get infite loop

Fix :  
Delete the value of iterator it point to 
call 2 iterator delete first iterator. Use second iter.
